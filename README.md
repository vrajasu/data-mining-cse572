# data-mining-cse572
The course had three mini-projects which consisted to using various Data Mining/Machine Learning algorithms on some dataset provided. We were required to implement the k-means algorithm using SSE. All the folders have their respective readme and report files with instructions to run the code. The code was written in MATLAB. In brief - 

Project 1 - Studying the application of k-nearest neighbor(KNN), Neural Network and Support Vector Machine classifiers on two-real world classification problems.

Project 2 - Studying the application of the k-means clustering algorithm and active learning for classification problems.

Project 3 - Studying the application of multi-label learning and ensemble learning on real-world applications

The projects dealt with the aspect of using various Data Mining and Learning Algorithms to form consensus about some given data
